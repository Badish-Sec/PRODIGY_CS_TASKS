# Internship Tasks Repository

Welcome to my internship tasks repository! Here you'll find the projects I worked on during my internship with Prodigy Infotech. Each project serves as a demonstration of my skills and growth throughout the internship period.

## Projects

### 1. Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher project is a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project demonstrates my understanding of basic encryption algorithms and their implementation in Python.

### 2. Image Encryption Program

The Image Encryption Program is a more advanced project where I developed a program to encrypt images using cryptographic techniques. It showcases my ability to work with more complex data types and algorithms, ensuring the security of digital assets.

### 3. Password Complexity Checker

The Password Complexity Checker is a utility program designed to assess the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, character types, and complexity rules. This project reflects my knowledge of cybersecurity principles and the importance of strong password policies.

### 4. Keylogger Malware

The Keylogger Malware project is a simulation of a malicious software that secretly records keystrokes on a computer. Although developed for educational purposes only, this project demonstrates my understanding of cybersecurity threats and the techniques used by attackers.

## Contributions

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to these projects. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have any improvements or ideas to share.
